    "# Introduction to Nodes in Rex\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Rex**, a **node** represents a fundamental computational unit within a graph-based system. Nodes encapsulate specific functionality and interact by passing data through connections, forming a network that can model complex systems. This tutorial introduces how to define nodes, specify their properties like rates and delays, and manage their interactions within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are defined by creating subclasses of the `BaseNode` class. This base class provides a standardized API and essential functionality that all nodes inherit. When defining a node, you can specify several parameters directly in the `__init__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`name`**: A unique identifier for the node.\n",
    "- **`rate`**: The frequency at which the node's `step` method is called (in Hz).\n",
    "- **`delay`** (optional): The expected computation delay of the node (in seconds).\n",
    "- **`delay_dist`**: A distribution representing variability in the node's computation delay, useful for simulations.\n",
    "- **`advance`**: If `True`, the node's `step` method triggers when all inputs are ready; if `False`, it throttles until the scheduled time.\n",
    "- **`scheduling`**: Determines how the node's execution is scheduled. Options include `Scheduling.FREQUENCY` and `Scheduling.PHASE`.\n",
    "- **`color`**: Used for visualization purposes.\n",
    "- **`order`**: Determines the node's order in visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of a node definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyNode(BaseNode):\n",
    "    def __init__(\n",
    "        self,\n",
    "        name: str,\n",
    "        rate: float,\n",
    "        delay: float = None,  # Expected computation delay (used for phase-shifting)\n",
    "        delay_dist: Union[DelayDistribution, distrax.Distribution] = None,  # Sim. computation delay\n",
    "        advance: bool = False,\n",
    "        scheduling: Scheduling = Scheduling.FREQUENCY,\n",
    "        color: str = None,\n",
    "        order: int = None\n",
    "    ):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, rate, delay, delay_dist, advance, scheduling, color, order)\n",
    "        # Additional initialization if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def init_params(self, rng: jax.Array = None, graph_state: GraphState = None):\n",
    "        # Initialize parameters\n",
    "        return MyParams()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def init_state(self, rng: jax.Array = None, graph_state: GraphState = None):\n",
    "        # Initialize state\n",
    "        return MyState()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def init_output(self, rng: jax.Array = None, graph_state: GraphState = None):\n",
    "        # Initialize default output\n",
    "        return MyOutput()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def step(self, step_state: StepState):\n",
    "        # Node's computation logic\n",
    "        new_state = ...\n",
    "        output = ...\n",
    "        return step_state.replace(state=new_state), output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes interact by passing outputs from one node to the inputs of another. This is achieved through the `connect` method, which establishes a connection between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection API\n",
    "\n",
    "When connecting nodes, you can specify several parameters that control the nature of the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`output_node`**: node whose output will be connected as an input.\n",
    "- **`blocking`**: `True`, the receiving node waits for the input before proceeding. This can create dependencies between nodes.\n",
    "- **`delay`**: An additional delay introduced in the connection, which can control the phase shift between nodes.\n",
    "- **`delay_dist`**: Used in simulation to model communication delays between nodes.\n",
    "- **`window`**: Determines how many past messages are stored and accessible in the input buffer.\n",
    "- **`skip`**: If `True`, the connection is skipped when messages arrive simultaneously, helping resolve cyclic dependencies.\n",
    "- **`jitter`**: Controls how to handle irregularities in message timing (e.g., `Jitter.LATEST` uses the most recent message).\n",
    "- **`name`**: A shadow name for the input; defaults to the output node's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Including `delay_dist` in Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delay_dist` parameter allows you to specify a distribution that models the variability in communication delay between nodes. This is particularly useful in simulations where network latency or message passing delays are significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolving Cyclic Dependencies with `skip`\n",
    "\n",
    "In graphs where nodes depend on each other's outputs (creating a cycle), the `skip` parameter can be used to resolve the dependency. By setting `skip=True` on a connection, you instruct the receiving node to proceed without waiting for the current message if it arrives simultaneously. This breaks the cycle and allows the system to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "node_a.connect(\n",
    "    output_node=node_b,\n",
    "    blocking=True,\n",
    "    delay=0.01,  # Expected communication delay (used for phase-shifting)\n",
    "    delay_dist=distrax.Normal(loc=0.01, scale=0.005), # Sim. communication delay\n",
    "    window=5,\n",
    "    skip=False,\n",
    "    jitter=Jitter.LATEST,\n",
    "    name=\"input_from_b\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `node_a` connects to `node_b` with a blocking connection, an added delay of 0.01 seconds, and a delay distribution for simulation purposes. The `window` size is set to 5, meaning the last five messages are stored. The `skip` parameter is `False`, so the node will wait for the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes manage four main types of data (defined as [pytrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/working-with-pytrees.html#patterns)), typically defined using immutable dataclasses for efficiency and safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters**: Static configurations that usually remain constant during execution.\n",
    "2. **State**: Dynamic data that evolves over time with each `step`.\n",
    "3. **Outputs**: Data produced by a node's `step` method and sent to connected nodes.\n",
    "4. **Inputs**: Buffers that hold incoming data from other nodes, respecting the specified window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Dataclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Using immutable dataclasses (e.g., via `@struct.dataclass` from Flax) ensures that the data structures are compatible with JAX's JIT compilation and functional programming paradigms. Additionally, dataclasses allow you to define specific methods related to the data structure, providing encapsulation and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@struct.dataclass\n",
    "class MyParams:\n",
    "    some_parameter: float\n",
    "\n",
    "    def adjust_parameter(self, factor: float):\n",
    "        return self.replace(some_parameter=self.some_parameter * factor)\n",
    "\n",
    "@struct.dataclass\n",
    "class MyState:\n",
    "    some_state_variable: jax.Array\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update_state(self, delta: jax.Array):\n",
    "        return self.replace(some_state_variable=self.some_state_variable + delta)\n",
    "\n",
    "@struct.dataclass\n",
    "class MyOutput:\n",
    "    some_output_data: jax.Array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `MyParams` and `MyState` include methods to adjust parameters and update state, respectively. This encapsulation enhances code organization and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Node data is initialized using specific methods that you should override:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`init_params`**: Initializes the node's parameters.\n",
    "- **`init_state`**: Initializes the node's state.\n",
    "- **`init_output`**: Provides a default output, useful for initializing input buffers in connected nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are typically called during the graph's initialization phase using `graph.init()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `step` Method in Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step` method defines how a node processes inputs and updates its state at each timestep. It receives a `StepState` object with all necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `StepState` Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`rng`**: Random number generator (updated if used).\n",
    "- **`state`**: Node's current state.\n",
    "- **`params`**: Static parameters influencing behavior.\n",
    "- **`inputs`**: Dictionary of `InputState` instances (keyed by input names).\n",
    "- **`eps`**: Episode number relates to the current computation graph used for simulation (unrelated to RL episode number).\n",
    "- **`seq`**: Current step number (auto-increments with each step).\n",
    "- **`ts`**: Timestamp at the start of the step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `InputState` in `step_state.inputs` contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`data`**: Messages from the connected node.\n",
    "- **`seq`**: Sequence numbers of the received messages.\n",
    "- **`ts_sent`**: Timestamps when messages were sent.\n",
    "- **`ts_recv`**: Timestamps when messages were received.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, accessing the most recent message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "latest_sensor_input = step_state.inputs['sensor'][-1].data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing the `step` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical steps to implement the `step` method can be condensed into the following block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step(self, step_state: StepState):\n",
    "    # Unpack StepState\n",
    "    rng, state, params, inputs = step_state.rng, step_state.state, step_state.params, step_state.inputs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Access latest input\n",
    "    control_signal = inputs['controller'][-1].data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Update state\n",
    "    new_state_variable = state.some_state_variable + control_signal * params.gain\n",
    "    new_state = state.replace(some_state_variable=new_state_variable)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Produce output\n",
    "    output = MyOutput(some_output_data=new_state_variable)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Update RNG if randomness is involved\n",
    "    rng, _ = jax.random.split(rng)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return updated StepState and output\n",
    "    return step_state.replace(state=new_state, rng=rng), output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Time and Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `eps`, `ts` and `seq` for time-dependent logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if step_state.ts > params.activation_time:\n",
    "    # Perform time-based logic\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Input Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input window size is greater than 1, you can access past messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "recent_sensor_data = inputs['sensor_input'][-3:].data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JIT Compilation and Side Effects Handling with External Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Rex advocates for JIT-compiling the `step` method of each node to enhance performance. However, interfacing with real hardware often involves side effects that JAX's JIT compilation doesn't handle natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include side-effecting code (e.g., sending commands to actuators, reading sensor data), you must use JAX's external callback mechanism. This involves wrapping side-effecting functions with `jax.experimental.io_callback` to ensure compatibility with JIT compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [JAX documentation on external callbacks](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external_callbacks.html) for detailed guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step(self, step_state: StepState):\n",
    "    # Compute outputs\n",
    "    output = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Side-effecting function\n",
    "    def _apply_action(action):\n",
    "        # Code that interacts with hardware\n",
    "        return np.array(1.0)  # Dummy return value\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wrap side-effecting code\n",
    "    _ = jax.experimental.io_callback(\n",
    "        _apply_action,\n",
    "        result_shape=jnp.array(1.0),\n",
    "        arg=output.some_output_data\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Update state and return\n",
    "    return step_state, output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Nodes and Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "When nodes interface with real hardware or external systems, additional lifecycle management is necessary. The `BaseNode` API accommodates this through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`startup`**: Called before an episode starts, allowing the node to prepare (e.g., initialize hardware).\n",
    "- **`stop`**: Called after an episode ends, enabling the node to clean up resources or safely shut down hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "By following these guidelines, you can define robust and efficient nodes within the Rex framework. Nodes can be customized extensively through their parameters and state, connected flexibly to form complex graphs, and optimized using JIT compilation. Proper handling of side effects ensures that nodes interfacing with real-world systems remain performant and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples, we'll implement specific nodes that illustrate these concepts in practice."
